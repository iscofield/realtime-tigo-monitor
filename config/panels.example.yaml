# Panel definitions - generated during setup, can be manually edited
# Copy this file to panels.yaml and customize for your setup

panels:
  # Example panel entry:
  - serial: "4-C3F23CR"           # Panel serial number from Tigo optimizer
    cca: "primary"                # Which CCA this panel connects to
    string: "A"                   # String name (must match system.yaml)
    tigo_label: "A1"              # Label as reported by Tigo
    display_label: "A1"           # Label shown in UI (can differ for translations)
    position:                     # Optional: position on layout image (Phase 2)
      x_percent: 35.5
      y_percent: 11.75

  # Example with translation (Tigo reports different label than display):
  # - serial: "4-C3F277H"
  #   cca: "primary"
  #   string: "F"
  #   tigo_label: "B9"            # What Tigo reports
  #   display_label: "F6"         # What we show in the UI

# Translations for label overrides (optional, for documentation)
# These are applied automatically based on tigo_label -> display_label mapping
translations:
  # "B9": "F6"
  # "B10": "F7"
