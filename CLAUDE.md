## Project Overview

Solar Tigo Viewer - A visualization tool for Tigo Energy solar panel monitoring systems. The project displays solar array layouts and monitoring data.

## Development Status

This project is in early planning stages. The `layout.png` shows the planned solar array visualization with color-coded sections representing different inverters/zones.

## Technology Stack

- Python 3 (preferred language for this project)

## Project Structure (Planned)

```
solar_tigo_viewer/
├── docs/specs/          # Specifications and design documents
├── layout.png           # Reference diagram for solar array layout
└── layout.xcf           # GIMP source for layout diagram
```

## Notes

- Reference `layout.png` for the visual design of the solar array grid
- The layout uses color-coded sections (pink, blue, orange, yellow, green, gray, cyan, brown) to represent different inverter zones or monitoring areas
