## updates
We need to enhance the readme with the following changes:
- the wizard, we should highlight the translation / mapping step during the wizard.  Allows for easily dragging panels across strings to ensure the physical topology can match the depicted topology
- we should highlight the auto detection of panels based on scanning the tigos which then feeds into the string assignemtn
- we should highlight the fact that it can detect potential misconfigurations of strings based on high deviations within strings
