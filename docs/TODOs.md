## updates
We need to add zoom in / out buttons on the GUI view.  I want to allow for zooming in / out. For some reason the viewport is constrained and it won't let me zoom out further to try and show everything on one page.  These buttons should be fixed on the screen and can allow a user to zoom in / out.  

As part of this, given we have text boxes that are overlayed on the image, this may be problematic.  Will this still work since  they are percentage based?  




I'd like to make each string box collapsible.  However, when collapsed, we should still display watts / voltage / amps for the entire string and then number of panels in parentheses
